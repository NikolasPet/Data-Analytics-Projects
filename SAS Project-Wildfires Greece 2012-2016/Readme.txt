This project focuses on analyzing wildfires in Greece from 2012 to 2016, using a comprehensive dataset containing meteorological and geographical information. The primary objectives are to understand the factors influencing wildfire duration and the size of burned areas. The analysis reveals that temperature, wind speed, and rainfall have varying effects on wildfire duration, while army involvement and aerial means, especially helicopters, contribute to larger burned areas.

The study proposes valuable insights to assist Civil Protection authorities in implementing effective measures to prevent and mitigate wildfire impacts. The findings underscore the importance of early warning systems, resource allocation, and community collaboration in combating wildfires and minimizing their extent.
